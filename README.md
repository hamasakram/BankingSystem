**SECTION-1:-**
Used Agile Approach as it is fast and efficient and stakeholder involvement is more. 
⦁	Our team first distributed the whole process into small tasks so that we can work accordingly. All the Screens were first made, e.g., Main Screen where all the main options are written, Sub-task screens and so on. 
⦁	We used collaborative approach, after making all the screens it is them joined together to a single GUI that is user-friendly.   
⦁	Changes were made according to the scenario, like if the customer is new, the new username and password created will also create the account number at the same time, there will be no need to create afterwards.
⦁	Making Structural diagrams to ensure the tasks division and working of software properly.
**SECTION-2:-**
My role in this project was as a developer. My task was to simply understand the requirements of the software system and according to that make a user-friendly software which I did using VS code in Python and connected the data inserted into csv file.
**SECTION-3:-**
⦁	The process was broken down into several jobs or every team member, making structural diagrams, behaviour diagrams were the task of one member.
⦁	After that comes the developer task that was done by me and another programmer. (as we used pair programming in this)
⦁	After that comes the testing phase that was implemented by our tester member, he tested every module one by one giving input to it and testing it that if the data is saved in csv file correctly or not. Every single module is tested on its own.
⦁	After testing comes the implementation phase, in this all the modules tested are joined into one complete unit.
⦁	And with this we reached our goal of completion of the project.
**SECTION-4:-**
**Prototype Designs:**

**SECTION-5:-**

In evaluating the software engineering tools and techniques, let me tell you about methodologies and agile processes: - 
**⦁	Methodologies: -**
⦁	Iterative development: The application’s development appears iterative, with features incrementally 	added and tested, reflecting Agile’s iterative nature. 
⦁	Customer Collaboration: The user interface elements, such as screens and buttons, indicates focus on customer interaction.  	
**⦁	Agile Processes:-**
⦁	  Scrum:
	    Sprints: As functions are in discrete iteration so it follows sprint-based approach.
	    Daily Stand-ups: While not shown, but there was daily check-ups and discussions upon this model. 
⦁	  Kanban: 
	    Visual Management: Flow of work items and screen management shows the workflow used akin kanban.
	    Continuous Delivery: As the project was big so many changes were integrated to this some things were added before and                             after and some things were left over as per the client demand. 
**⦁	Project Management: -**
	  Timeline Management: Each iterations have different timeline approach and other settings.
	  Resource Allocation: Resources are allocated differently for different usage, like, SQLite used for data storage and                               tkinter is used for GUI. 
	  Planning: All the modules and things that are implemented here or designed were first planned by team members and after               that it was declared as final project model. 


In conclusion, project management techniques are evident in the structured development approach, resource allocation, and risk management considerations within the provided code. By formalizing project planning and enhancing risk assessment practices, the software engineering process can be further optimized for successful project delivery.
